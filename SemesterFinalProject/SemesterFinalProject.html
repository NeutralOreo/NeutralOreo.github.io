        <h2 id="first">Welcome to the unofficial SLUH Latin IV Website!!</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="article grid_4">
        <p>In this website, there are 4 important pages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Home Page,</li>
            <li>Latin Phrases,</li>
            <li>and the Latin Poet we are studying,</li>
          </ul>
        <p>If you click on the links, you will get better explanation for the purpose of those pages. This page is the home page.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="article grid_4">
        <p>This page is the home page, because it explains everything. Acccording to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_page">wikipedia.com</a>"A home page or a start page is the initial or main web page of a website or a browser. The initial page of a website is sometimes called main page as well."</p>

      <div class="article grid_4">
        <p>So, what is Latin? Latin is a language that was used by the ancient Roman civilization. Some scientists say that Latin is actually the best language. Don't look that up, just believe me. Anyway, this website is here to explain the Latin IV curriculum, and maybe even teach you a thing or two.</p>

        <figcaption>This is the cover photo of the book that we area reading in our class. This is the Aenead!</figcaption>

      <div class="article grid_6">
        <p>Latin IV is my favorite subject, because the content is very interesting to me. However, the class is pretty hard. The assesments are over the content that we read in class. That means that you need to have a basic understanding from 50 to over 200 lines just for one quiz! But don't let that scare you, because the teacher, Mr. Esswein, is a great teacher who loves to meet up with his students to help get through his class.</p>

      <div class="article grid_6">
        <p>Do you like this format? I made it to look like columns... You know... Like Latin Temples... Never mind... Anyway, this was styled with 960 grid format, which is a really helpful tool that making styling easy! I also have a javascript function that changes the greeting near the top of the page. Refresh in order to get a different greeting. I really hope it works LOL. Anyway, that's about it for the home page, feel free to go out and look at some other links in my website.</p>
